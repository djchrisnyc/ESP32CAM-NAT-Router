## Steps I followed
1. Write the steps you followed here.  This way you can keep track of where you might have messed up if the project does not work. 
I floww the steps in the video
First i download both of the files that was needed 
than i extract them so i can run them on my pc
i ran flash tool to set up the files from the esp32 folder onto flash tool
once i did that i began the up load once the upload was finsih
i open up a web browser and enter the ip address so i can connect to the esp32 router 


## Problems
Note your problems or errors here.  Google any error you may come across, and not what you tried (even if it does not work), and what was the final answer.
I had no issuse it was pretty stright forward
